# CCS QCD Miniapp README for HPCI FS

## Evaluation

Both of the two target problem sizes, classes 4 and 5, need to be
evaluated as a strong-scaling problem. The basic performance
requirement is that one BiCGStab solver has to be done within 3.1 mili
sec. The clover routine, while relatively takes minor execution time,
also need to be at least faster than 20% of the BiCGStab
solver. Number of nodes, process, and threads can be freely chosen.

Whether these requirements are satisfied is displayed at the end of
program execution. Below is an example of a class 1 result:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Estimated BiCGStab time for   10000 iteratins :     18.3824
Upper bound BiCGStab time for 10000 iteratins :     31.0000
Clover time:                   0.0625
Upper bound Clover time:       0.0662
BiCGStab performance requirement: PASS
Clover performance requirement:   PASS
